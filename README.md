# BankNote_Authentication
- A small project on ML deployment using Flask and Docker.
      

             



## Requirement

- To predict whether a bank note is authentic or not.
## Steps Involved

       1. Collection of data.
       2. Analysis and Preprocessing of data.
       3. EDA
       4. Feature Scaling if required.
       5. Featuring Selection
       6. Model Building
       7. Deployment


## Description
        Data is imported to python environment where it is analysed and preprocessed.
        EDA, Feature scaling and selection is done where ever applicable.
        Model is built and trained using Logistic Regression.
        Validation Check is done using confusion matrix and classification report.
        Finally it is serialized and deserialized using pickle and therefore deployed
        using Flask,Swagger,Streamlit and Docker.
        
        
## Streamlit
        Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens.
        Run Streamlit run app1.py
